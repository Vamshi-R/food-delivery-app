 /**
 * key property
 * always we are looping something in JSX we need to provide unique key property
 * example: 
 *   {
                resObj.map((restaurant) => (
                    <RestaurantCards key={restaurant?.id} resData={restaurant} />

 *  why do we need key prop ?
 * to avoid re-rendering of all the data when a new data is added to same data we need to pass key prop
 * if we dont keep the keys then it will clear everything and render again because it doesnt know
   where new data to be added.
 * Dont assign indexes to keys, why not use index as key in react ? browse and learn about it.
 * not using keys is not acceptible <<<<<< index as key (atleast not a best practice) 
                 <<<< unique id (best practice)

 /**

 Homework: can we use named export along with default export

 //keep your component short and mimize the code to 100 to 200 lines
 // if it exceeds more than 200 lines break it into multiple components

 What is a functional component ? 
  - It is a normal javascript function

 #React Element 
   -  is a plain javascript object


#React Hooks
   - Hook -> is a normal JS utility function given to us by react with some superpowers.
   - useState() -> superpowerful state variables.
                -> whenever a state variable has changes it re renders the component
                -> const [state, ssetState] = useState(default value);
                -> its an destructuring of an array
                -> const arr = useState(some value)
                -> const [state, setState] = arr;

                further break down
                const state = arr[0];
                const setState = arr[1];

              // important - for practical refer Header component Logout and Login button changes
              -> useState re renders the component when state variable is updated > updates the UI 
              -> local variable (JS variable) does not rerender the component 
              -> const [state, setState] = useState()
              -> how can we set value to a constant, once setter function is called entire function(component)
               is invoked again and its a new variable assigned to constant and can be updated with new value.

               // whenever a state variable update, react triggers a reconciliation process(re renders the component)

                this is what happening behind the scenes
   - useEffect() -> is a normal JS functions
                 -> it takes two arguments -> callback function and dependency array
                 -> its called after the component's render cycle is completed
                 -> if you want to perform something after component is rendered useEffect is the one to use.
                 -> first everything inside component is rendered first and then useEffect is called  by default
                 -> useEffect is called on every render of component if no dependency array is there
                 -> if there is a dependency array its behaviour changes
                 -> if there is an empty dependency array => useEffect is only called once on initial render
                 -> if dependency array is [listOfRestaurant] => useEffect is called every time 
                 [listOfRestaurant] is updated.

    - Do's and Dont's -> never create a state variable outside of a functional component
                      -> Always define a state variable at the begining of functional component
                      -> Avoid creating inside if/else/for/functions it will cause inconsistencies in a program


# Reconcialition algorithm -> (React Fiber (After React 16))

-> https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture 
above link to learn in depth about react fiber

- Reconcialition -> is whenever something changes in UI
- React Fiber -> new way of finding difference and updating DOM

-> For example a container has 7 cards
-> on click we have filtereed 3 cards based on rating, now container has 3 cards
-> old virtual DOM has 7 cards
-> New virtual DOM has 3 cards
-> on change diff algorithm triggers and if found differnce it updates the DOM

- virtual DOM -> is an representation of actual DOM
              -> console.log(<Body />) -> React Element -> Retyrns Object 
              -> It is nothing but normal javascript object

# Diff algorithm

- whenever a state variable is set or something changes in UI
       -> it triggers Diff algorithm
       -> it compares the difference between old virtual DOM(JS object) and new virtual DOM (JS object)
       -> If found difference its updates the DOM else it wont

- Why React is fast because
     - doing efficient DOM manipulation -> bcoz it has virtual DOM
     - bcoz it perform diff algorithm on changes
     - updates the DOM if there is difference


#shimmer UI

-> idea of shimmer UI is you need to show something by default as soon as the page loads

-> load component
-> render with shimmer UI
-> make api call, after the data is recieved
-> render again with help of state variable

# Routing ^6.27.0
-> npm i react-router-dom
-> createBrowserRoute -> to configure Routing
-> RouterProvider -> to provide configuration to our app
-> children array for defining child routes
-> errorElement for loading not found page
-> useRouteError() hook to log error in that page
-> Outlet -> to define where to render child routes -> to load children inside our oultlet
-> Link -> provide by react router dom 

#Link
-> works exactly same as anchor tag
-> Link is an wrapper around anchor tag behind the woods
-> it will not reload the entire page
-> anchor tag will reload the entire page
-> <a href="/"></a> -> will reloads the enitre page
-> <Link to={"/restaurant"+param}>Some Name</Link> -> will just changes/load the component in DOM.

# 2types of routing in web apps

1.client side routing - not using a network call to fetch page/component
2.server side routing - making an network call to get a component/page


# Dynamic routing

ex : path: '/restaurant/:resId' => resId is the dynamic route
-> useParams() -> to read route params
